                <h3>Solutions</h3>
                <h4>Recommendation 1</h4>
                <p>With the results that we collected, we gathered together as a team and started to work on our proposed solutions for Fable.</p>
                <br>
                <p>From our first task, one of our users failed to complete the task due to the pick up time selection being difficult to see. To resolve this, when a user clicks on order online, the first screen that they see would be a pop up that prompts them to set a pickup or delivery time.</p>
                <div class="mockup-holder">
                    <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/fable/solution3.jpg" alt="Fable Kitchen re-design order online popup">
                </div>
                <p>Following this, we ensured that their selection would be locked at the top of the screen so that the users could see the date and time selected, as well as give them an option to change it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Next, since our users struggled to acknowledge that certain items could only be ordered at certain times, we highlighted the order times for different sections of the menu in a bright red so that users would notice it more easily. </p>
                <div class="mockup-holder">
                    <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/fable/solution4.jpg" alt="Fable Kitchen re-design order online menu">
                </div>
                <h4>Recommendation 2</h4>
                <p>From our second task, we saw our users get frustrated with the excessive amounts of scrolling they had to do to explore the menu, along with getting frustrated with the ambiguous titles.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To resolve this we implemented a simple filtering system, that allowed users to cycle through specific parts of the menu with a single click, rather than scrolling back and forth repeatedly. We also changed the titles to be clear for our users to understand, as well as included a symbol associated with vegan options. </p>
                <div class="mockups">
                    <div class="mockup-holder">
                        <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/fable/solution1.jpg" alt="Fable Kitchen re-design home page brunch menu">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <h4>Recommendation 3</h4>
                <p>Finally, from our third task, we saw that our users found the reservation section of the page to be hidden and hard to notice.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To make the reservation section stand out, we re-arranged the navigation to give the reservation section its own button to make it a clear call to action. Once a user clicks on that button, rather than scrolling down to the bottom of the page, it sends our user to a new separate page where they can make their reservations.</p>
                <div class="mockup-holder">

                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <p>This project further enhanced by abilities in running research and tests with users, and then applying the results that we gathered into creating prototyped solutions to address issues that we found. The next step would be to test the prototypes that we created and gather feedback to see if there would be possible issues with our proposals. </p>
