                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Creating a name for a fictional company and switching companies with a peer. I was tasked with taking the name "The Cookie Jar" and creating the branding and a product mock-up. I first created a logo, followed by a business card. Finally, I created graphics created and a box of cookie mix which I felt was the perfect representation for the type of products that the company would sell. </p>

                <h3>Logo Design</h3>
                <h4>Logo roughs</h4>
                <p>To start off, I began hand drawing some doodles to inspire some ideas for logos roughs. I tried out different visuals for the process of creating cookies. With all of them, I tried to incorporate the universally known chocolate chip cookie. I decided to go with the one that would be the easiest to see and visualize even at a small size.</p>

                </div>
                <h4>Final Logos</h4>
                <p>I ultimately decided to go with the logo of the cookie with a bite taken out of it. Once I had decided on this logo, it was time for me to enter Adobe Photoshop to mock it up using smart layers, and to decide on my colour and font choices.</p>
                <div class="final-holder final-logo">
                    <img class="lazy final-rough" src="/images/cookie-jar/thumbs/logo-one.png" alt="Final logo thumb 1">
                </div>
                <p>At the start of this project, I was given a single colour that I was required to implement into the company logo. The colour given to me by my peer was the pink colour seen below. I decided to match it up with the light orange colour to place on the cookie. Next, I had to decide the font that I wanted to place onto the logo itself. After experimenting with many fonts by placing it onto my logo. I wanted to emphasize an elegant yet almost playful type font for the company.</p>

                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <h4>Business Card</h4>
                <p>Once I had my logo created, it was time for me to create a business card to go along with the company. I began by introducing 2 new colours to go along with the 2 existing ones. The four colours that I present below allows me to create a fun and playful design for the company. I wanted to use the vibrant colours to go along with the colours on my logo to catch people's attention.</p>

                            <div class="cookie-color-four swatch"></div>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The image below is the final mock-up of the business card I created. I split the 2 additional colours I had into the top and bottom of the card. I do so to create contrast to separate the contents on the card. I used the blue on the upper half because it allowed the logo to be easier to see and read when compared to the green. I put a divider between the 2 to distinguish that they are 2 different entities of the company.</p>
                <div class="card-holder">
                    <img class="lazy myImages business-card myImg" src="/images/cookie-jar/card.png" alt="Business card mockup">
                </div>
                <h4>Product</h4>
                <h5>Research</h5>
                <p>Following the business card, I decided to create a product mockup for the company. I first began by looking at different examples of cookie mix boxes to get an idea of the type of content that different companies display, as well as their box dimensions. The first thing I noticed was that all images of the boxes showed 3 sides of the box. The front, the side, and the top. The next thing I immediately noticed was that almost all boxes used real images of the cookies, rather than drawn up graphics.</p>
                <div class="mockups">
                    <div class="mockup-holder">
                        <img class="lazy" src="/images/cookie-jar/box-example-1.png" alt="Example cookie mix box 1">
                    </div>
                    <div class="mockup-holder">
                        <img class="lazy" src="/images/cookie-jar/box-example-2.png" alt="Example cookie mix box 2">
                    </div>
                    <div class="mockup-holder">
                        <img class="lazy" src="/images/cookie-jar/box-example-3.png" alt="Example cookie mix box 3">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h5>Photos for Mockup</h5>
                <p>The first thing I did was get images of cookies so that I could use on my product mock-up. I went to the nearest grocery store and bought myself a box of cookies to serve as a model. I began first by putting the images onto the plate to set up the shot for the front of my box. Next, I decided I also wanted to use an image of cookie for the side of my box. I decided to stack the cookies all on top of each other as seen on the right.</p>
                <div class="photo-holder">
                    <img class="left-photo myImages myImg" src="/images/cookie-jar/render/CookieTop.png" alt="Cookies stacked on plate">
                    <img class="right-photo myImages myImg" src="/images/cookie-jar/render/CookieSideLong.png" alt="Tall cookies on plate">
                </div>
                <h5>Graphics for Mockup</h5>
                <p>Once I had my images ready, it was time to create the graphics for the mock-up. I wanted to implement the same colours that I used on my business card, as well as keep the same overall design to maintain consistency across. I once again decided to make a split on the box, similar to how I split it on the card. I also came up with the slogan "Your Favourite Cookie Mix" and decided to place that at the top of the box.</p>
                <p>I first began by placing the images in locations I felt were best for visualization, and then proceeded to place the content around it. I used the research I had to get an idea of what type of information was displayed on the box, and then proceeded to fill out my graphics. In addition to the company logo for 'The Cookie Jar', I also created a logo for my peer and placed that at the top left of the graphics.</p>
                <div class="mockup-holder">
                    <img class="lazy myImages myImg" src="/images/cookie-jar/render/combined.png" alt="Combined mockups">
                </div>
                <h5>Product Mockup</h5>
                <p>Finally, it was time to create a 3D render of the product. I continued to use photoshop and inputted the box measurements that I had collected to create the box shape. I then proceeded to place my graphics on top of the box and continuously went back and forth between the mock-up and the graphics to adjust visibility. One thing I decided to do as well was to create a 3D effect on the top of the box to emulate a realistic, pullable tab.</p>
                <p>Once I had my graphics the way they looked on top of the box it was time to add some texture. I went and collected a cardboard box texture, a cookie texture, and a chocolate texture to use as possible bump maps. I created a 3D effect on the text and placed the cookie texture on top of it. I decided to also create a 3D chocolate chip, and placed the chocolate texture I had on top of it.</p>
                <p>With my graphics and textures completed, it was time to adjust the lighting on the project. I first focused on the box to ensure that the product itself was realistically lit up and visible. Following that I adjusted the lighting to allow the tagline and the textures on those mock-ups to be visible as well.</p>

                    <img class="lazy myImages myImg" src="/images/cookie-jar/render.jpg" alt="3D product mockup">

            <div id="takeaways" class="section-spacing">
                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <p>Overall, this was a long and tedious project. Being my first time creating in 3D there was a large learning curve. As well, it was my first time creating a product or designing for a company that wasn't my own. This means that having that communication back and forth with my peer was extremely important. I had to ensure that the results I achieved at each step along the way was up to their standards. Going through the process of researching competitors and mocking up and creating a beautiful final result for someone else was super fun.</p>
                <p>It was an amazing experience for me to be able to practice what working with other partners or companies would be like in the real world. I hope to be able to apply the knowledge and skills I developed throughout this project and be able to continuously apply it to any future work opportunities that I have.</p>
