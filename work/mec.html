                    <p>A heuristic analysis is an evaluation of user interface design using usability principles that determines what should be the best practices for web design.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once we applied the evaluation to the MEC website, we found that the lowest scores were ‘Forms and Data Entry’ and ‘Search’, while the highest scores were ‘Trust and Credibility’ and ‘Page Layout and Visual Design’. Our results imply where users would have the most trouble with on the website, and where they would have the most positive feedback. </p>

                            <p>The navigation posed a challenge for a lot of our users. However we found that this is due in part to the fact that many users would have different preferences in terms of what products they want given a certain scenario.</p>

                <p>Based on the comments we recieved from our participants we tested, we developed a list of potential solutions to their pain points. To ensure we are prioritizing the most relevant issues first.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The PXL Prioritization Framework uses a binary scale find out the most important issues based on ease of implementation and impact.</p>

                <p>Once we had our results, we decided on the 3 that would be the most impactful.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Recommendation 1</h4>
                <p>During the first task, only 50% of our participants used the compare function because they first clicked into the cart page and did not see it there. For the participants that used the compare function, they had to click back to each individual item and add it to their compare list.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Our recommendation to fix this issue would be to implement the compare function into the cart page. This will allow users to compare all the items currently in their cart, without having to go back to the product pages to add items to their compare list.</p>
                <div class="mockup-holder">
                    <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/mec/solution1.jpg" alt="MEC cart page with added compare function">
                </div>
                <h4>Recommendation 2</h4>
                <p>One issue that we found was that after a user makes an account and signs in, they still need to make a membership account and add the “membership” card to their cart. This process was confusing because they needed to have a user account and then another membership account in order to make a purchase.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Our solution to this was to combine the two processes together, so that when you make an account, you also begin making a membership. On the first page you would enter an email and password, and when you click next, the user is prompted to enter the rest if their details to create the membership.</p>
                <div class="mockups">
                    <div class="mockup-holder">
                        <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/mec/solution3.jpg" alt="MEC create an account and membership page 1 of 2">
                    </div>
                    <div class="mockup-holder">
                        <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/mec/solution2.jpg" alt="MEC create an account and membership page 2 of 2">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h4>Recommendation 3</h4>
                <p>During our testing process, we found that when users wanted to click into an individual item to view more information, it brought them to a whole new page. In order to return to the original page, they either had to use the browers return page button or use the breadcrumbs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To fix this issue, we decided to add quick view function. On this quick view pop-up, you can see what sizes are avaliable and the different colours. This makes it easy to return to the original items page without having to use the browsers return page function.</p>

                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <p>This project my first introduction to a larger case study with teammates. During this study I was able to use new tools such as the usability hub and create think aloud tasks. We were able to take in the feedback and results from our testing, and understand how use that information to propose solutions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I hope to be able to bring my experience and knowledge that I obtained during the course of this project, and apply it to further ones.</p>
