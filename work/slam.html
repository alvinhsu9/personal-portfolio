            <div id="slam-research" class="uiux-testing section-spacing">
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Growing up, I learned to watch basketball on TV with my father. Every night, whenever there was a game on you would expect to see us on the couch. As I got older I began following their athletes on social media and taking in more content about the stars off the court. That's where SLAM Magazine came into play.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While this was a good site in terms of content, they had a lot of issues in terms of their functionality and overall appearance. I decided to do a case study on SLAM Magazine, and provide solutions to any issues I find. I began going through all the pages on the site, and decided to focus on the following:</p>
                <div class="mockups">
                    <div class="mockup-holder">
                        <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/slam/page2.PNG" alt="SLAM home page">
                    </div>
                    <div class="mockup-holder">
                        <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/slam/page4.PNG" alt="SLAM navigation open">
                    </div>
                    <div class="mockup-holder">
                        <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/slam/page3.PNG" alt="SLAM article page">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h4>Issues</h4>
                <p>The design itself was very cluttered and often-times hard to follow. There was also clear inconsistency in the layout of the home page. I also found that there were no filtering or sorting functions on their article page. This forced users to have scroll through thousands of pages of articles just to find a specific one. Finally, I noticed there was no way for a user to save a specific article to read later. In order to analyze the overall site more completely, I decided to follow the Design Thinking Process.</p>
                <img src="/images/slam/design-thinking.png" alt="Design thinking process">
            </div>
            <div id="slam-user" class="uiux-results section-spacing">
                <div>
                    <h3>Users</h3>
                    <h4>Empathize</h4>
                    <h5>Analysis</h5>
                    <p>First, I created a task analysis to identify a list of possible users for SLAM, and gage a better understanding of the possible tasks that they could perform on the website.  </p>
                    <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/slam/analysis.png" alt="Task analysis">
                    <h4>Define</h4>
                    <h5>Persona</h5>
                    <p>Once I finished analyzing the website, identifying issues, and realizing tasks, it was time for me to find my ideal user and find their pain points, needs, and goals. Being an individual who uses this website often, I was able to create the persona of “Basketball culture enthusiast” based off of my personal identification and relationship with the website. </p>
                    <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/slam/persona.png" alt="SLAM Persona">
                    <h5>Journey Map</h5>
                    <p>The user journey map is a visualization that helps with the process of how a user interacts with a website and the emotions they have when trying to accomplish their goals. It also helps in creating insights and opportunities for improving the user experience by describing the users pain points more in depth.</p>
                    <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/slam/journey-map.png" alt="SLAM Journey map">
                        <p>After creating this journey map, I found there to be 5 main painpoints for a user that needed to be addressed.</p>
                    <div class="slam-pain-points">
                        <ol>
                            <li>The home page</li>
                            <li>The articles page</li>
                            <li>A profile page</li>
                            <li>Notifications</li>
                            <li>The navigation Menu</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="slam-prototyping" class="uiux-solutions section-spacing">
                <h3>Prototypes</h3>
                <h4>Ideate</h4>
                <p>I then began the third step of my process, which was to Ideate. I began by creating a new site map for the website to make the navigation headers more specific and easier to understand.</p>
                <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/slam/sitemap.png" alt="SLAM site map">
                <h4>Wireframes</h4>
                <p>Once I finished the site map, and taking note of the pain points discussed prior, I proceeded to create wireframes Adobe XD. Creating wireframes allows me to better visualize how I am going to re-design.</p>
                <div class="mockups">
                    <div class="mockup-holder">
                        <h4 class="mockup-header">Home</h4>

                        <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/slam/wireframes/Footer.png" alt="Footer wireframe">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h4>Prototype</h4>
                <p>In addressing the pain points that I previously discussed, I entered Adobe Photoshop to create mockups of the website with my proposed changes/adjustments. I then moved these mockups into an Invision prototyping screen to test out interactivity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the homepage, one of the first things that I changed was the layout. I ensure that the layout of the website was consistent throughout the page. I also added 3 dots to every image linked to an article, that would prompt the user to save the article.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Finally I included a profile and notification icon. These were created so users could go to their profile to see their saved articles and so they would be able to get alerted when new articles they were interested in were released.</p>
                <div class="mockup-holder">
                    <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/slam/prototypes/homepage.jpg" alt="Home page prototype">
                </div>
                <p>For the articles page I added the sort and the filter functions onto the page for conventionality. These are both functions that users are familiar with using, and would allow them to be able to simplify the types of articles they see, rather than forcing them to have to scroll. </p>
                <div class="mockup-holder">
                    <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/slam/prototypes/Articles.jpg" alt="Articles page prototype">
                </div>
                <p>This create a profile page was created for those who wanted to sign up and be a part of the SLAM team. A simple and clear form for users to fill out so that they could be a part of a community. </p>
                <div class="mockup-holder">
                    <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/slam/prototypes/create-profile.jpg" alt="Create profile prototype">
                </div>
                <p>The profile section was created primarily for users to be able to have a section where they can save their articles to. It allows users to create an account for themselves where they can change their notification settings and personal information.</p>
                <div class="mockup-holder">
                    <img class="myImages myImg" src="/images/slam/prototypes/profile-page.jpg" alt="Profile page prototype">
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>Test</h4>
            <h5>Feedback</h5>
            <p>Once I had completed my mockups in Adobe Photoshop, I moved these screens into Invision and added interactivity to them. I then proceeded to ask some peers to test the usability of the new proposed website and to provide feedback.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The key suggestions that I received were:</p>
            <div class="slam-feedback">
                <ul>
                    <li>Emphasize "featured" articles more as that is a topic that seems important</li>
                    <li>Not enough padding around font</li>
                    <li>Try a different font for better readability</li>
                    <li>Adjust size and weight of font in certain areas</li>
                    <li>Add dots to show progressions for featured</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="slam-takeaways" class="project-takeaways section-spacing">
                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <p>This was my first official case study as a UI/UX researcher and designer. I was able to learn new skills like using invision or using a design thinking method to create personas and journey maps. These tools allowed me to go through a step-by-step process in creating high fidelity mockups to provide as solutions. Taking my time and ensuring that each step was completed before moving on the next allowed me to create the highest quality work that I could. In addition to that, being able to receive feedback from others on how I can improve on my solutions helped me immensely. I think overall that this project has allowed me to become a greater UI/UX designer.</p>
